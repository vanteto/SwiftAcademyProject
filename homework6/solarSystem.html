        <h2>Solar system</h2>
        <p>The Solar System[a] is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either
            directly or indirectly.[b] Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets,[c]
            with the remainder being smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects
            that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.[d]
            <br>
            <br> The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular
            cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained
            in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily
            composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the
            terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium;
            the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively
            high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane.
            All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.
            <br>
            <br> The Solar System also contains smaller objects.[e] The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars
            and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's
            orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly
            of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these populations are several dozen
            to possibly tens of thousands of objects large enough that they have been rounded by their own gravity.[10] Such
            objects are categorized as dwarf planets. Identified dwarf planets include the asteroid Ceres and the trans-Neptunian
            objects Pluto and Eris.[e] In addition to these two regions, various other small-body populations, including
            comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, at least
            four of the dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites,[f] usually termed
            "moons" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects.</p>
